# Known Issues

* Currently in production page refresh does cause disruptions because React Router is used to 
make navigation clearer. The endpoints do not actually exist in backend so when page is refreshed, 
page is, of course, not found. This needs further work

* Lack of filtering and pagination makes the application fairly difficult to use
